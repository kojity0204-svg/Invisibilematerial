  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>If there is one thing everyone has fantasised about at least
once in their lives, it is the ability to be invisible. Not
stealthy, not a social pariah, but transparent. Animals are
some of the finest biological examples; although not true cloaking, they manage to hide in plain sight due to the color of their
fur, which is the result of millions of years of evolution. But
what if you could become totally see-through, making you literally invisible? Well, that’s exactly what metamaterials can do.
They are capable of bending light around an object, making
it impossible to see that object. Imagine wearing the invisibility cloak from the Harry Potter series, only this one is not
magic but made of incredibly precise, manufactured materials.
These materials are made of tiny structures that are smaller
than the wavelength of light and can have a negative index
of refraction, which makes them capable of manipulating the
electromagnetic radiation that comes in contact with them.
Using Einstein’s theory of relativity as a crux, we can calculate
how light would bend in those materials, making it possible to
bend all different frequencies of light, resulting in total invisibility. This idea is very well described by imagining a rock in
the middle of a river. The water would flow around the rock
and continue on its path.
